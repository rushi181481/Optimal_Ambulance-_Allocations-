This project aims to predict the prices of flats using various machine learning techniques. We utilize models such as *Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and **Gradient Boosting Regression to predict flat prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, stories, and parking availability.

## Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting flat prices using machine learning models. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of different regression models and determine which model provides the most accurate flat price predictions based on various property features. The dataset used in this project includes the flat's area, number of bedrooms, number of stories, and parking availability.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features that are used to predict flat prices:
- *Area*: The total area of the flat in square feet.
- *Number of Bedrooms*: The number of bedrooms in the flat.
- *Stories*: The number of stories in the building.
- *Parking Availability*: A binary value indicating whether parking is available (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Models and Algorithms
The following regression models are used to predict flat prices:
- *Linear Regression*: A simple model to predict the flat prices based on linear relationships between features.
- *Decision Tree Regression*: A tree-based model to capture non-linear relationships in the dataset.
- *Random Forest Regression*: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Gradient Boosting Regression*: An advanced ensemble model that sequentially corrects the errors of previous trees.


### Hyperparameter Tuning
Each model undergoes *GridSearchCV* for parameter tuning to select the optimal configurations for better performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models:
- *R-squared*: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: Measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
